# machine-learning-using-different-methods-Superconductivty_UCL-data
This repository has several branches which each one focuse on using one machine learning method on superconductivity data set
in order to predict critical temperature of a series of supercutors.
The data set as csv file can be downloade here.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Superconductivty+Data
For the prediction, different machine learning algorithms and methods (from linear regression to neural networks) are applied.
The original papers  as well as the data set are also added to the repository.

Data Set Information:
There are two files: (1) train.csv contains 81 features extracted from 21263 superconductors along with the critical temperature in the 82nd column, (2) unique_m.csv contains the chemical formula broken up for all the 21263 superconductors from the train.csv file. The last two columns have the critical temperature and chemical formula. The goal here is to predict the critical temperature based on the features extracted.
