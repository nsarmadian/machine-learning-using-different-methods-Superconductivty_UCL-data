# machine-learning-using-different-methods-Superconductivty_UCL-data
This repository has several branches which each one focuse on using one machine learning method on superconductivity data set
in order to predict critical temperature of a series of supercutors.
The data set as csv file can be downloade here.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Superconductivty+Data
For the prediction, different machine learning algorithms and methods (from linear regression to neural networks) are applied.
The original papers  as well as the data set are also added to the repository.
